This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

i have been a little obsessed about dreams, both the concept and contents of it, for as long as i can remember. it mostly stems from the fact that i dream quite a bit and they are usually super vivid. therefore made this stupid little web app. very new to next.js so struggled a bit even though it's so simple. 

deployed it using Vercel: https://dreamify.vercel.app/

paid text to image generation probably could've made it much better but im broke. lmk if you like it.
